This folder structure uses i-PI to combine the physical potential and the PIGS correction encoding quantum dynamical effects for a water molecule. It uses LAMMPS/n2p2 to fit the PIGS correction potential. Use `setup.sh` to create a folder structure of short weakly-thermostatted simulations (the current example only runs one simulation but provides code to run many) and `getacfs.sh` to calculate the vibrational spectrum averaged over several short trajectories.
